## Phase 2: Skills, Learning Loop & TELOS System

### Phase 2A: Tier 1 Foundational Skills (Build First — These Power Everything)

> These are the engine. Nothing else works well without them.
> Build order matters — each enables the next.

| # | Task | Build In | Why This Order |
|---|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | ~~**`extract-wisdom` skill**~~ DONE | Cursor | Core extraction engine. Every other skill feeds from this |
| 2 | ~~**`create-summary` skill**~~ DONE | Cursor | Needed for efficient memory writes |
| 3 | ~~**`create-pattern` meta-skill**~~ DONE | Cursor | Once this works, you can prompt "create a new skill for X" and it self-assembles |
| 4 | ~~**`learning-capture` skill**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Hooks into Claude Code lifecycle, needs settings.json access. Also fixed stop hook to stop creating stub signals |
| 5 | ~~**`telos-update` skill**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Needs to read session history + write to telos/ files |

### Phase 2B: Tier 2 Thinking & Analysis Skills

> These make Jarvis smarter at reasoning. Build after Tier 1 is solid.

| # | Task | Build In | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 6 | ~~**`analyze-claims` skill**~~ DONE | Cursor | Fabric pattern format |
| 7 | ~~**`first-principles` skill**~~ DONE | Cursor | Based on PAI Thinking Pack |

| 15 | ~~**`security-audit` skill**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Needs file system + security context |

### Phase 2D: Hooks & Infrastructure

> System-level wiring that must be done in Claude Code.

| # | Task | Build In | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 16 | ~~**Implicit sentiment analysis**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Built into learning-capture skill (sentiment detection in session analysis) |
| 17 | ~~**Signal synthesis workflow**~~ DONE | Claude Code | New `/synthesize-signals` skill — reads signals, writes synthesis, archives processed |
| 18 | ~~**AI Steering Rules auto-generation**~~ DONE | Claude Code | New `/update-steering-rules` skill — analyzes failures/synthesis, proposes CLAUDE.md updates |
| 19 | ~~**Skill assembly pipeline**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Updated `create-pattern` to auto-save to `.claude/skills/` and confirm registration |
| 20 | ~~**Session-start hook upgrade**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Now loads TELOS status, active projects, learned entries, skill commands |

### Phase 2E: TELOS Continuous Update System

| # | Task | Build In | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 21 | **Voice transcript ingestion** — Process voice recordings into session history | Claude Code | Moved to Phase 3C — see `memory/work/jarvis/PRD_voice_mobile.md` for full architecture |
| 22 | ~~**Session transcript → TELOS extraction**~~ DONE | Claude Code | Workflow: `/extract-wisdom` on input → `/telos-update` with output. No separate skill needed |
| 23 | ~~**TELOS diff reporting**~~ DONE | Claude Code | New `/telos-report` skill — analyzes git history + TELOS changes + signal trends |

## Phase 3: Orchestration, Agents & UI (Future)

### Phase 3A: Agent Orchestration (Tier 4 Skills)

- [x] `delegation` skill — Route tasks to specialized agents (PAI Delegation model)
- [x] `spawn-agent` skill — Compose agents from traits dynamically (PAI Agents Pack)
- [x] `workflow-engine` skill — Chain skills into multi-step workflows (Fabric "Stitches")
- [x] `project-orchestrator` skill — Manage multi-project state and priorities

### Phase 3B: External Integrations

> **Ideal state — agreed:** **TELOS + Notion:** read-heavy (pull context for grounding), **selective write** to Notion only when a workflow explicitly allows it. **Canonical identity** stays in-repo: `memory/work/telos/*.md` is updated from **merged** context (Notion + sessions + chat), not replaced blindly by Notion.
>
> **Slack:** Enforced routing in **`memory/work/slack-routing.md`** — **`#epdev`** [`C0ANZKK12CD`](https://ericpdev.slack.com/archives/C0ANZKK12CD) = routine (default); **`#general`** [`C0AKR43PDA4`](https://ericpdev.slack.com/archives/C0AKR43PDA4) = must-see only. **ClaudeActivities** app reused; **MCP route A**.
>
> **Miessler / PAI alignment:** Prefer **PAI-shaped** wiring: MCP for external tools, **hooks** as nervous system, **Fabric** patterns, **structured events** — see PAI’s observability direction (e.g. `pai-observability-server` / event capture in the PAI repo). Use **Langfuse or similar** only if you want hosted LLM tracing and it fits deployment better than PAI-style telemetry.

- [x] **Notion (MCP)** — 🧠 Jarvis Brain structure created (Inbox, Journal, Goals & Growth, Ideas, Music, Jarvis Reports, TELOS Mirror). Page registry at `memory/work/notion_brain.md`. Session-start hook Notion read + auto-write to Reports/Mirror pending (Phase 3E era).
- [x] **Slack (MCP)** — `#epdev` routine traffic via ClaudeActivities app confirmed working; stop hook posts session-end summaries. Full MCP read/write integration deferred — current posting flow meets needs.
- [x] **Calendar (MCP)** — `@cocal/google-calendar-mcp` working. OAuth via `gcp-oauth.keys.json`. 3 calendars loading (primary, Family, Holidays). Validated 2026-03-27.
- [x] **Gmail (MCP)** — `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp` working. Web app OAuth client (separate from calendar Desktop client). Credentials at `~/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json`. Scopes: `gmail.modify` + `gmail.settings.basic`. Validated 2026-03-27. **Note**: requires new session to load tools.
- [x] **ntfy** — `ntfy_notify.py` + `hook_notification.py` built; `Notification` hook wired in `settings.json`. Topic: `epdev-ntfy` on ntfy.sh. **Pending**: `setx NTFY_TOPIC epdev-ntfy` → restart terminal → smoke-test.
- [x] **Observability Phase 1** — `hook_events.py` captures all PostToolUse events to `history/events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. Research brief at `memory/work/observability/research_brief.md`. Phase 2 (Langfuse) deferred to Phase 3E+.

### Phase 3C: Voice & Mobile Interface

> **PRD / ISC:** `memory/work/jarvis/PRD_voice_mobile.md`
> **Ideal state:** Eric can speak an idea on his iPhone and it lands in Jarvis's memory pipeline within minutes. He can also reach a full Jarvis terminal session from mobile. Voice sessions produce signals identical in quality to chat sessions.
>
> **Architecture updated 2026-03-27:** Slack replaces custom voice server as the mobile hub.
> New layers:
> - **Layer 1 (capture):** iPhone voice → transcript → inbox → `/voice-capture` → signals ✅
> - **Layer 2 (Slack mobile hub):** Dictate/type to `#jarvis-inbox` → Slack poller → `claude -p` → reply in thread
> - **Layer 3 (remote CLI fallback):** Tailscale + SSH → full Claude Code session on desktop
> - **Layer 4 (conversational loop):** ElevenLabs TTS — deferred to Phase 3F
>
> **PRD:** `memory/work/slack_mobile_hub/PRD.md`

#### Layer 1: Voice Capture (COMPLETE)

- [x] **3C-1: Inbox structure** — Create `memory/work/inbox/voice/` and `memory/work/inbox/voice/processed/`; document format in PRD
- [x] **3C-2: `/voice-capture` skill** — New Claude Code skill: reads Notion Inbox via MCP, extracts signals with `Source: voice`, queues TELOS-relevant content for `/telos-update`
- [x] **3C-3: Voice capture transport** — **Architecture change**: Notion app (iPhone) → built-in voice transcription → Jarvis Brain Inbox page → Jarvis reads via Notion MCP. iCloud and OneDrive no longer required. `voice_inbox_sync.py` archived (no longer needed for Layer 1). Notion Inbox page ID: `32fbf5ae-a9e3-8198-9975-cbc6293c8690`.
- [x] **3C-4: Register skill + session hook** — Add `/voice-capture` to session-start banner; `/voice-capture` now reads from Notion Inbox via MCP

#### Layer 2: Slack Mobile Hub (ACTIVE — supersedes 3C-6/3C-7)

- [ ] **3C-Slack-1: Channel setup** — Create `#jarvis-inbox`, `#jarvis-voice`, `#crypto-bot-commands` in Slack workspace. Add `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_JARVIS_INBOX_ID`, `SLACK_JARVIS_VOICE_ID`, `SLACK_EPDEV_ID` to epdev `.env`. **[MANUAL — Eric]**
- [x] **3C-Slack-2: `tools/slack_poller.py`** — Built. Polls `#jarvis-inbox` every 60s; runs `claude -p` from repo root (CLAUDE.md context auto-loads); replies in thread. State in `data/slack_poller_state.json`.
- [x] **3C-Slack-3: `tools/slack_voice_processor.py`** — Built. Polls `#jarvis-voice` every 60s; runs voice-capture prompt headlessly; writes signals to `memory/learning/signals/`; posts confirmation in thread.
- [x] **3C-Slack-4: Heartbeat → `#epdev`** — Already operational (`jarvis_heartbeat.py` posts to #epdev via SLACK_BOT_TOKEN).
- [x] **3C-Slack-5: `tools/start_jarvis.bat`** — Built. Launches poller + voice processor in separate CMD windows; runs heartbeat once on startup.
- [ ] **3C-Slack-6: End-to-end test** — Dictate into `#jarvis-inbox` from iPhone → Jarvis replies in thread within 90s. Log result in `history/changes/`.

#### Layer 3: Remote CLI Fallback

- [ ] **3C-5: Tailscale + SSH setup** — Install Tailscale on desktop + iPhone; install Blink Shell (iOS); confirm full `claude` CLI session from iPhone over Tailscale. Document in `docs/EPDEV_JARVIS_BIBLE.md`.

#### Layer 4: Conversational Voice Loop (DEFERRED → Phase 3F)

- ~~**3C-6: `jarvis_voice_server.py`**~~ **SUPERSEDED** by Slack mobile hub (3C-Slack-2). HTTP voice server no longer needed.
- ~~**3C-7: iOS Shortcut → POST to voice server**~~ **SUPERSEDED** by native Slack dictation.
- [ ] **3C-8: Whisper STT integration** — **DEFERRED to Phase 3F** — native iOS dictation sufficient for Phase 1.
- [ ] **3C-9: ElevenLabs TTS integration** — **DEFERRED to Phase 3F** — read Slack replies on mobile.
- [ ] **3C-10: End-to-end voice session test** — **DEFERRED to Phase 3F** — reframed as full TTS loop test.

#### Phase 3E-Slack: Slack Bot Socket Mode (FUTURE)

> Full slash commands + Block Kit buttons. Specced after Phase 3D session.
> PRD to be created: `memory/work/slack_bot/PRD.md`

- [ ] Slack Bot Socket Mode setup — slash commands: `/status`, `/positions`, `/approve`, `/pause`
- [ ] Block Kit trade approval cards — Approve / Reject / Half Size buttons for crypto-bot (replaces Telegram)
- [ ] App mention: `@Jarvis summarize my week`

#### Cross-cutting

- [ ] **Voice signals tracked in heartbeat** — Add `voice_session_count` metric to heartbeat; alert in `#epdev` when no voice sessions in 7 days (behavioral gap signal for Phase 5)
- [x] **Dashboard UI** — Replaced by jarvis-brain-map project (standalone repo). Phase 3.5 vitals route will serve as the dashboard. See `memory/work/jarvis_brain_map/PRD.md`.

### Phase 3D: Visual system of record & ideal-state workflow (SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE)

> **Status:** Replaced by standalone `jarvis-brain-map` project. PRD, research, architecture, and Phase 1 parser all complete. Remaining work tracked in `memory/work/jarvis_brain_map/PRD.md`.
>
> **Dependency note:** Phase 3E can now proceed — the “current vs ideal” vocabulary is defined by the brain-map node/edge taxonomy and ISC gap model.

- [x] **Clarify requirements** — Completed via `/project-init` pipeline: `/research` → `/first-principles` → `/red-team` → `/create-prd`. Brain spec defined in `memory/work/jarvis_brain_map/PRD.md` — nodes = TELOS/Goal/Project/Phase/PRD/ISC/Task/Skill/Signal; edges = drives/defines/decomposes-into/gap/etc. Git-markdown is source of truth; brain-map is read-only through Phase 3.
- [x] **Survey tooling** — React Flow + Next.js + dagre chosen. Research brief at `memory/work/jarvis_brain_map/research_brief.md`. Compared Obsidian, Mermaid, custom dashboard. Decision: standalone `jarvis-brain-map` repo at `C:\Users\ericp\Github\jarvis-brain-map`.
- [x] **Current vs ideal workflow** — ISC gap model: `[x]`=met (green), `[ ]`=open (red). Parser reads PRDs + tasklist, emits gap edges. Phase 3.5 vitals dashboard will visualize trends. `/vitals` skill (3E capstone) will report health to terminal.
- [x] **Claude Code analysis session** — Full repo scan + analysis done 2026-03-27. Parser expansion roadmap defined (Phase 2.5). Vitals dashboard scoped (Phase 3.5). Cross-project dependency mapped: brain-map 3.5 depends on epdev 3E.

### Phase 3E: ISC engine & scheduled heartbeat

> **Parallel with 3C:** Layers 2+3 of 3C (Tailscale, voice server, STT/TTS) are independent of 3E. Build whichever has energy — they don't block each other. 3D is now complete (brain-map), so 3E can proceed.
>
> **Intent:** A **time-driven VERIFY** loop—Miessler-style **current state** as measurable data points, compared to **PRD ISC**, with **gaps** flowing into **learning** (signals/failures), not only when you are in a chat session.
>
> **Example:** Every 30 minutes (configurable) a **heartbeat** job runs collectors (tests passing, defensive suite, file counts, hook self-check, optional health probes), scores each mapped **ISC** or “slowly improve” feature dimension, and **emits** structured notes when gaps or regressions cross thresholds.

- [ ] **ISC engine PRD** — Spec in `memory/work/`: map each PRD ISC line (or feature dimension) to **metric keys**, **thresholds**, **severity**, and **when to write a learning signal** vs suppress noise
- [ ] **Metric collectors** — Small, pluggable modules (stdlib-first): e.g. run `tests/defensive/`, parse results, repo counters, optional lint; output a single **snapshot JSON** per run
- [ ] **`heartbeat` runner** — One CLI entrypoint (e.g. `tools/scripts/jarvis_heartbeat.py`) that loads config, runs collectors, diffs vs last snapshot, updates `memory/work/{project}/STATE.md` or a dedicated **heartbeat log** under `memory/work/` or `history/changes/`
- [ ] **Scheduler** — **Windows Task Scheduler** (primary on your machine) or cron/WSL; document interval (e.g. 30 min), failure alerts, and log rotation in `docs/EPDEV_JARVIS_BIBLE.md`
- [ ] **Gap → learning pipeline** — On regression or sustained gap: append **`memory/learning/signals/`** (and **`failures/`** if user-defined) with template: ISC ref, observed metrics, delta, suggested next action; optional link to `orchestration/tasklist.md` bullets
- [ ] **Security & safety** — Heartbeat reads repo only; no secrets in logs; validate outputs against `security/constitutional-rules.md`; cap signal volume (dedupe, cooldown) to avoid spam
- [ ] **Optional integrations** — Phase 3B: **ntfy** on regression; Phase 3C: dashboard reads last heartbeat JSON
- [ ] **AI Steering Rules cadence** — Define ritual: after each `/synthesize-signals` pass (or monthly minimum), run `/update-steering-rules` to promote synthesis findings into `CLAUDE.md` behavioral corrections; log cadence in `docs/EPDEV_JARVIS_BIBLE.md`
- [ ] **Agent-based hooks** — Upgrade `PreToolUse` validator (`security/validators/`) from shell script to Python agent: enables MCP tool access, richer logic, testability, and AST-based bash command approval (Dippy pattern from awesome-claude-code). Do after heartbeat is stable — hooks must not block ISC collection.
- [ ] **`/vitals` skill (3E capstone)** — New Jarvis skill: runs heartbeat check, reads snapshot JSON + events JSONL + signal counts + ISC state, reports PAI health to terminal. Includes: skill usage frequency, ISC gap closure rate, signal velocity, task completion rate, missing skill detection. **Also powers brain-map Phase 3.5 `/vitals` route** (web UI for same data). Create skill only after heartbeat + collectors are working.
- [ ] **[ISC 0/10] Context budget as vitals metric** — Token/context efficiency must be tracked in `/vitals`. Hook output size (char count proxy), MCP schema overhead estimate, and per-session burn rate should be measured and surfaced. ISC: hook output under 300 tokens | session context at 50% triggers warning | `/vitals` reports context efficiency score. **Why:** hook fires every user message — untracked context burn silently degrades long sessions and inflates cost. **Metric sources:** hook output char count, manual session benchmarks, future API usage headers. Implement alongside heartbeat collectors.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 maturity (signals/synthesis patterns), Phase 3D “current vs ideal” spec (shared vocabulary for gaps). **Build in:** mostly **Claude Code/Python** + OS scheduler; Claude Code sessions **review** trends and promote steering rules. **Feeds into:** jarvis-brain-map Phase 3.5 vitals dashboard.

---

---

## Phase 3E → Phase 4 Gate (must pass before starting Phase 4A)

> **This gate protects Phase 4 from building on an empty foundation.** Phase 4 autoresearch iterates over accumulated signals and session history — if neither exists, the loop has nothing to improve on.

- [ ] **Heartbeat running** — `jarvis_heartbeat.py` is scheduled and has produced at least one successful snapshot JSON
- [x] **Learning loop active** — 97+ signals captured (10 raw + 87 processed), well past >=5 threshold. Validated 2026-03-27.
- [x] **At least one synthesis run** — 5 synthesis docs in `memory/learning/synthesis/`. Last: `2026-03-27_synthesis.md`.
- [x] **AI Steering Rules updated once** — Multiple steering rule updates merged into CLAUDE.md (MCP transport, hook paths, crypto-bot rules, etc.). Validated 2026-03-27.
- [x] **PAIMM AS1 verified** — Session-start hook loads TELOS status, active projects, signal counts, skill registry, recent security events. Confirmed across 4+ sessions 2026-03-27.

---

## Phase 4: Autonomous self-improvement (background Jarvis)

> **PRD / ISC:** `memory/work/jarvis/PRD.md` — **state:** `memory/work/jarvis/STATE.md`  
> **Intent:** Jarvis **self-improves** via automation that does **not** depend on human chat sessions: measure progress toward ideal state, harvest **curated** external patterns (web, GitHub, YouTube, Claude docs), run **[Karpathy-style bounded autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)** over **TELOS + learning signals + session history** (writes proposals only — see PRD §4D), and **notify Slack** by importance (`memory/work/slack-routing.md`). Human sessions approve merges, secrets, and TELOS changes.

### Phase 4A — Ideal-state loop & heartbeat (extends 3E)

- [ ] **ISC mapping** — Wire `jarvis_heartbeat` (and collectors) to explicit thresholds from `memory/work/jarvis/PRD.md` ISC lines
- [ ] **Gap → learning** — When metrics cross thresholds, append structured signals (template references ISC); dedupe and cooldown
- [ ] **Windows Task Scheduler** — Document tasks for heartbeat interval; env inheritance (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`); log rotation pointer in `docs/EPDEV_JARVIS_BIBLE.md`
- [ ] **Subagent tool scoping** — Define MCP tool access policy per agent role: security validators cannot access Slack/Notion MCPs; voice agents cannot write to core memory; research agents get read-only file access. Document policy in `security/constitutional-rules.md` and enforce via settings.json subagent config.

### Phase 4B — Autonomous research & pattern harvesting

- [ ] **Source allow-list** — Create `memory/work/jarvis/sources.yaml`; seed with Miessler's own repos first: PAI GitHub, TheAlgorithm, Fabric patterns, PAIMM posts, Unsupervised Learning newsletter — these are the highest-signal sources for Jarvis's current development
- [ ] **Human source review ritual** — After first research run, ask Eric: "What other sources should be added? (YouTube channels, blogs, GitHub repos, newsletters)" — capture answers in sources.yaml and `history/decisions/`
- [ ] **Research runner** — Scheduled job: fetch/summarize → draft digest → optional `memory/learning/signals/` with `Source: autonomous` or inbox folder for review
- [ ] **Cowork vs scheduler split** — Document which steps run as OS jobs vs sandbox agent prompts (per PRD architecture table)
- [ ] **Interleaved thinking for orchestration skills** — Enable interleaved thinking on `/delegation`, `/workflow-engine`, and `/spawn-agent`: think→tool→think→tool pattern dramatically improves multi-step research and agent composition. Configure via `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` header on Claude API calls inside these skills. Do alongside research runner — this is where it pays off most.
- [ ] **Tool Search API** — When skill/tool count exceeds 50, implement Tool Search to prevent token explosion in orchestration loops. Evaluate as part of research runner architecture — autonomous research will eventually need to query 100+ tools by description without loading all schemas upfront.

### Phase 4C — Slack notifications by severity

- [ ] **Notifier wrapper or policy** — Map event types to `#epdev` vs `#general` per `slack-routing.md`; implement daily cap / dedupe
- [ ] **Heartbeat + research digests** — Routine summaries → `#epdev`; regressions and must-see criteria → `#general` only when rules match

### Phase 4D — Capstone: internal autoresearch (Karpathy-inspired)

> Pattern from [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch): human-steered **program**, bounded runs, **one writable surface** for the agent (here: review tree only — not live TELOS). Full spec: `memory/work/jarvis/PRD.md` §4D.

- [ ] **`autoresearch_program.md`** — Create `memory/work/jarvis/autoresearch_program.md` (mission, metrics, step limits, what “better understanding” means)
- [ ] **Review tree** — `memory/work/jarvis/autoresearch/` for runs, proposals, logs; canonical TELOS remains merge-only after human review
- [ ] **Read scope** — Documented inputs: `memory/work/telos/`, `memory/learning/signals/` (+ synthesis/failures as needed), `memory/session/` (time-bounded)
- [ ] **Runner** — `tools/scripts/jarvis_autoresearch.py` and/or documented Cowork/Claude Code batch prompt that enforces read/write boundaries
- [ ] **Metrics per run** — Persist snapshot in run artifact (e.g. contradiction list, open questions, checklist score — per program file)
- [ ] **Integration** — Optional signals with `Source: autonomous`; optional `#epdev` Slack when impact or delta crosses threshold
- [ ] **Human merge path** — Document workflow: review queue → `/telos-update` or manual edit → delete or archive run

**Depends on:** Phase 4A–4C foundations; TELOS and learning layout stable enough to iterate; **Phase 3D "current vs ideal" spec must exist** before writing `autoresearch_program.md`. **Decision:** `history/decisions/2026-03-27_phase4-autonomous-self-improvement.md` (update with 4D)

---

## Phase 4 → Phase 5 Gate (verify before starting Phase 5)

- [ ] **PAIMM AS2 verified** — Jarvis is proactive: heartbeat runs without human prompt, background research produces signals, Slack digests fire on cadence
- [ ] **Autoresearch loop has run ≥3 cycles** — `memory/work/jarvis/autoresearch/` contains ≥3 dated run artifacts with metrics
- [ ] **Steering rules updated from autonomous signals** — at least one CLAUDE.md change promoted from a `Source: autonomous` signal
- [ ] **Voice capture Layer 1 live** — iOS Shortcut → iCloud → `voice_inbox_sync.py` → inbox pipeline confirmed working end-to-end; at least one real voice signal exists in `memory/learning/signals/` with `Source: voice`
- [ ] **Remote terminal Layer 2 live** — Tailscale installed on desktop + iPhone; Blink Shell confirmed; full `claude` CLI session reachable from iPhone over Tailscale from outside home network
- [ ] **Phase 5 scoped** — `memory/work/jarvis/PRD_phase5.md` stub exists with initial behavioral-change goals defined

---

## Phase 5: Daemon-inspired behavioral change (exploration)

> **Status:** planning stub — requires Phase 4 completion and focused design session.
> **Concept:** Miessler's forthcoming "Daemon" project targets behavioral change — not system improvement but *human behavior*. Phase 5 closes the loop from AI-augmented capability to actual life change: guitar practice, health systems, financial momentum, self-discovery.
> **Key principle:** Jarvis observes patterns in TELOS goals vs. actual session/signal evidence, surfaces behavioral gaps, and proposes concrete habit/action suggestions — without being a nag or replacing human agency.

### Phase 5A — Exploration & design (do this first)

- [ ] **Define what "behavioral change" means for Jarvis** — Study Miessler's Daemon concept; write a short spec: what signals indicate behavioral gap vs. system gap? (e.g. "no guitar session logged in 14 days" vs "heartbeat threshold crossed")
- [ ] **Map TELOS goals to observable signals** — For each TELOS goal (guitar, health, financial, self-discovery), define: what does evidence of progress look like in session/signal data?
- [ ] **Design review ritual** — How does Jarvis surface behavioral proposals? (Slack digest? Session-start banner item? Weekly Telos report?) — must not be spam; must be actionable
- [ ] **PRD Phase 5** — Write `memory/work/jarvis/PRD_phase5.md` with ISC, non-goals, and architecture before building anything

### Phase 5B — Implementation (after 5A spec is solid)

- [ ] TBD — defined during Phase 5A design session
